# Open Source Syringe Pump
Syringe pump designed for Empty Nose Syndrome

<h2>Introduction</H2>
I created this device to help people who suffer from Empty Nose Syndrome to sleep better.
This device has been designed to inject physiological serum in nose during night to moisten the nasal cavity and increase airflow sensation.
In addition heated wires can be plugged in order to heat the nasal cvity, again for increase sensations.

<h2>3D printed parts</h2>
The 3d files are in two folders for the both format .step and .stl, .stl can be used directly to print the part. .step is usefull if you want to modify the design.

<h2>Electronics parts</h2>
The project is based on the well know and cheap arduino nano micro controler which control a stepper motor via a motor driver.

<h2>Mechanical parts</h2>

<h2>Exploded views and nomenclature</h2>

<h2>Operation</h2>
Three touch buttons control the device, the two arrows are used to move forward and backward, it is the manual mode.
The disc on the center is the automatic mode, when it is pressed the carriage move forward a little bit each X minutes depending of what is programmed.
